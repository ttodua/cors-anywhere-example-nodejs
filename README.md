Based on [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) module, this example script quickly spins-up a CORS server at localhost address `127.0.0.1:6789`, so you can use it for your own usage (in applications or tests).

# Install
Clone this repository and run `npm i` to install dependencies. _(Note: We void any responsibilities related to the safety of those third-party modules)_

# Usage
To start the CORS proxy, run:
```
npm run start
```

Then you can access any site by visiting: `http://127.0.0.1/https://example.com`
